About the project
=================

Playing steel darts and counting score by hand or by a mobile app was kind of a bummer for me. So first I designed a scoreboard app to track dart games. But at that point I was just using them like any other mobile app to keep track of the score. So this project was born.

The idea
========

I was thinking of a system with multiple cameras pointed at the scoreboard from above. It should use video capturing and image processing to determine where the dart hit the board.

The structure
=============

The software is supposed to run either on a mini computer like a raspberry pi or any other hardware like a real computer or latop, running linux, next to the dart board. There are several webcams (2-4) hooked up to the system which are above the board. You are using a normal steel dart board and normal steel darts and you will not have to buy any special dart hardware. The complete system might be built into a sleek compartment housing all together with additional LED-stripes for good lighting (Also refer to :ref:`the building example <Compartment>` for details).

A few words on the coding language
==================================

As I am using python a lot at work it came naturally to me to use python here as well.
Also I think it will address a broad community if someone wants to contribute.
