Welcome to puffyCV's documentation!
===================================

This is the documentation of the project puffyCV. It will provide camera recognition of steel darts thrown to a dart board. It is designed to work together with the |Dart-O-Mat 3000|, my scoreboard project to track darts gaming score.
